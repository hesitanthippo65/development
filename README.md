### Goal and Value of the Application
The goal of this application is to allow you to navigate the Books on the Square Favorites 2022 List. 

### Usability Principles Considered
I considered hierarchy for each of the book tiles and also using headings and organization principles. Unfortunately my grid wasn't working, but in an ideal world it would have been responsive as well! 

### Organization of Components
The main component is the Book component, but I also included a Cart (and faulty Favorites list) to function as my aggregator -- which wasn't entirely working. 

### How Data is Passed Down Through Components
Data is passed through props that we can use to get access specific information about components. 

### How the User Triggers State Changes
The user triggers state changes by pressing the sorting and filtering buttons. 
In an ideal world, the reset button would work... but alas, here we are. I 
felt relatively good about the code itself for the aggregator, but unfortunately 
did not have the time to figure out why it wasn't working..
